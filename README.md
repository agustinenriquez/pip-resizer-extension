# PiP Resizer Extension

This extension converts standard videos into a vertical “slice” format. It’s great for reshaping YouTube or other embedded videos into a PiP-friendly aspect ratio. Whether you’re multi-tasking or just want a better vertical view on your content, this extension provides a convenient resized window and a simple way to enter Picture-in-Picture mode.
